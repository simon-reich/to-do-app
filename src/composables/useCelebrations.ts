// Which frame-animation celebration (see TodoCard.vue's "Celebration-
// Animationen" section) each Todo gets is decided once, when it's sent to
// Focus (see stores/todos.ts's sendToToday) — not re-rolled every time its
// check-menu happens to open. Living here rather than in TodoCard.vue lets
// the store assign a key without importing anything animation/SVG-related;
// TodoCard.vue's own ALL_CELEBRATIONS (importer/size/duration/anchor per
// key) is the only place that needs to know what a key actually renders as.

// of the same one occasionally repeating several times in a row, same
// trick as TodoCard.vue's old particle-effect bag.
